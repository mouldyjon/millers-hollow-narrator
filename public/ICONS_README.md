# PWA Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you'll need to add the following icon files to the `/public` directory:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons should feature a moon or werewolf theme to match the Miller's Hollow game aesthetic.

## Generating Icons

You can use online tools like:

Or create your own using design tools like Figma, Canva, or GIMP.

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can duplicate the Vite logo or use any PNG image and resize it to the required dimensions.
