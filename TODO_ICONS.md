# PWA Icons Required

The app needs proper PWA icons before publishing. Currently missing:

## Required Icons:
- `/public/icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `/public/icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Design Suggestions:
- Moon icon (representing werewolves/night)
- Village silhouette
- Werewolf paw print
- Miller's Hollow themed design

## Temporary Solution:
For now, you can use a simple online tool like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or create with any image editor

## Colors to match app theme:
- Primary: #0f172a (slate-900)
- Accent: #d97706 (amber-600)
- Text: #f1f5f9 (slate-100)

Upload the generated icons to `/public/` directory.
